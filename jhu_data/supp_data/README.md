On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts started differentiating between confirmed
positive cases and presumed positive cases. Confirmed positive cases are those
who received a positive PCR test, indicating that they are actively infected
with the virus. Presumed positive cases are those who received a positive
antibody test and either showed COVID-19 symptoms or were exposed to someone
with COVID-19. On June 1, 2020, there was a huge spike in the number of
reported cases in MA because the state government grouped together confirmed
positive and presumed positive cases, whereas before June 1, only confirmed
positive cases were counted as positive. Also, on June 1, the MA state
government updated all previous case data to differentiate between confirmed
positive and presumed positive on the state level. On the county level, on June
1 they updated all counties' case count on all prior days to include both
confirmed and presumed positives but do not differentiate between the two types
of positives.

In the official state numbers, there is a big spike in cases on June 1 because
of this reporting issue. We attempt to rectify this by using the difference
between confirmed and presumed positive cases on June 1 and confirmed and
presumed positive cases on May 31 as the number of new cases on June 1 at the
county level. We obtained these figures from the MA coronavirus data portal:
